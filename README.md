### Design Pattern 
* Factory Method
   - ShapeClass
   - RectangleClass -> ShapeClass
   - SquareClass -> ShapeClass
* Singleton -> maintain entire flow
    - logError
    - logSuccess

### Data Structure
* Queue -> Rectangle & Square pushed
    - if perimeter crosses 100, dequeue the shape and push onto Stack.
    - if area crosses 200, pop the shape from Queue.
* Stack -> store the shapes that receives from Queue dequeue shapes.

### conditions
* check perimeter or area has to be in O(1) time complexity
